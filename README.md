# personal-small-projects
This repo contains my personal projects.

Bird vs Pets: I have implemented a a game that is similar to a popular game "Plant vs Zombies" using JAVA programming language. 
I have used object oriented principles to build my game and utilized JAVA front end techniques and tools to impleemnt the interface of the game. 

Sudoku solver: I have implemented a sudoku solver using a 2d array backtracking algorithm. I used techniques from my Data structures & algorithms class 
to solve this problem. I have done some moderate testing for this program using Junit4 test cases.
